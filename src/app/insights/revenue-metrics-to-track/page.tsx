        <p>
          In today's competitive behavioral health landscape, understanding your facility's financial
          performance is more critical than ever. Beyond simply tracking monthly revenue, successful
          behavioral health leaders monitor specific metrics that provide deeper insights into their
          business health and growth potential.
        </p>

        <p>
          At The Growth MD, we've analyzed data from hundreds of treatment centers to identify which
          metrics correlate most strongly with sustainable growth and profitability. Here are the five
          key revenue metrics every behavioral health facility should be tracking.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Average Daily Rate (ADR)</h2>
        <p>
          Your Average Daily Rate represents the average revenue generated per occupied bed per day.
          This metric provides immediate visibility into your pricing effectiveness and reimbursement performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>How to calculate it:</strong> Divide total revenue for a period by the number of patient-days
          in that same period.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Target benchmark:</strong> While this varies by program type and geography, residential programs
          typically target $800-1,200 per day, while PHP/IOP programs aim for $400-600 per day.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Improvement strategies:</strong> Review and renegotiate payer contracts, optimize service
          offerings, improve clinical documentation to support higher levels of care.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Revenue Per Available Bed (RevPAB)</h2>
        <p>
          While ADR shows revenue per occupied bed, RevPAB accounts for both rate and occupancy, giving you a
          more complete picture of your revenue generation capacity.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>How to calculate it:</strong> Multiply your ADR by your occupancy rate (expressed as a decimal).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Target benchmark:</strong> Aim for at least 75% of your ADR. Top-performing facilities achieve
          85-90% of their ADR.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Improvement strategies:</strong> Focus on both census improvement and rate optimization simultaneously.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Length of Stay (LOS)</h2>
        <p>
          Length of Stay directly impacts total revenue per admission and affects clinical outcomes. Optimizing
          LOS – not just maximizing it – is crucial for sustainable growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>How to calculate it:</strong> Track the average number of days from admission to discharge across
          all patients.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Target benchmark:</strong> This varies significantly by program type, but residential treatment
          centers typically target 28-35 days, while detox programs aim for 5-7 days.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Improvement strategies:</strong> Implement stronger utilization review processes, improve clinical
          documentation, develop step-down programs to extend the continuum of care.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Revenue Cycle Metrics</h2>
        <p>
          The efficiency of your revenue cycle dramatically impacts cash flow and total collections. Key metrics
          to track include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):</strong> The average number of days it takes to collect payment after service is provided</li>
          <li><strong>Clean Claim Rate:</strong> Percentage of claims submitted without errors</li>
          <li><strong>Denial Rate:</strong> Percentage of claims denied by insurance companies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Target benchmarks:</strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>DSO: Under 40 days</li>
          <li>Clean Claim Rate: Above 95%</li>
          <li>Denial Rate: Below 5%</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Improvement strategies:</strong> Implement verification of benefits prior to admission, establish
          dedicated utilization review staff, and conduct regular billing training.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Patient Acquisition Cost (PAC)</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding how much you spend to acquire each new patient helps optimize marketing spend and calculate
          true return on investment.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>How to calculate it:</strong> Divide total marketing and admissions expenses by the number of
          admissions in the same period.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Target benchmark:</strong> Ideally, your PAC should not exceed 10% of the average revenue per
          admission. For a 30-day stay at $1,000 per day ($30,000 total), your PAC should stay under $3,000.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Improvement strategies:</strong> Track conversion rates at each stage of your admissions funnel,
          implement targeted marketing campaigns, and develop referral partnerships.
        </p>

        <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
        <p>
          These five metrics provide a comprehensive view of your facility's financial health. By tracking them
          consistently and setting improvement targets, you can make data-driven decisions that lead to sustainable
          growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most successful behavioral health organizations use dashboard systems to monitor these metrics in
          real-time, allowing for quick interventions when trends move in the wrong direction.
